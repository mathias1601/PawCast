/**
 * THIS IS NOT BEST PRACTICE AND IS A HUGE SECURITY RISK IF CODE IS MADE PUBLIC.
 *
 * But, we do this to make setup easier when sharing between team members and examiners. In a real scenario we would
 * find a better solution like storing them on a server so we are able to change them without hard updating the app.
 *
 * Again this is not what we would do outside of this project, but is done to avoid friction in handing over API keys.
